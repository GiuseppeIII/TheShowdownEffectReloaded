### Announcing The Showdown Effect: Reloaded League ###

With *The Showdown Effect: Reloaded* having been released over three months ago now (wow!), there has been a bit of a lull in activity in the game. To help remedy this and as a fun community activity we are proud to announce **The Showdown Effect: Reloaded League**. 

Every week we will have an officially sanctioned ranked match time (for playing both Showdown and Teams modes). Details about these matches will be kept in [#events](https://discord.gg/jUDTSUUTkG). If you are interested in participating you can sign up for the first date, this upcoming Sunday 12/4 at 10:00 PM GMT. The number and exact time of matches in future weeks are subject to change. While these will be 'ranked' matches, we greatly encourage players of all skill levels to participate in these events!

At the end of a season the players with the highest elo and most played games in both Showdown and Team modes will be memorialized in the [#hall-of-fame](https://discord.gg/jUDTSUUTkG) and get a unique discord role, with exclusive in-game awards coming in the future. Winners in each category will also receive 250,000 AC. 

The season dates are as follows:
- Winter: December 1, 2022 – February 28, 2023
- Spring: March 20, 2023 – May 31, 2023 
- Summer: June 1, 2023 – August 31, 2023
- Fall: September 1, 2023 – November 30, 2023
